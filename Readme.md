scientific calculator

This application Converted in to TypeScript Its basically specify all the types on static way. 
On this application it's perform different type of calculations on calculator.

-Its include many functions like basic maths function plus, minus, multiplication, division, modulo and many more. 
-In trigonometric functions perform the particular function like in the sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec and give the value. 
-It's also include memory fuctions like memory-plus, memory-minus, memory-clear, memory-recall and memory-stack (memory-save). 
-In logarithm they include log and ln(natural logarithm) 
-They have many extra fuctions like exponent(e),clear(C),PI, absolute, 1/x ,plus/minus, and .(dot) 
-Square fuctions like squareroot and square and ten paw. 
-In basic math functions includes floor,ceil,round and trunc.
-On triginometry and math function use the interface to forcefully follow the function type string 
-The TypeScript compiler (tsc) converts the instructions written in TypeScript to its JavaScript equivalent.
-The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. 
-TypeScript will compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax errors. 
-This helps to highlight errors before the script is run.
-Typescript if not suport ES6 feature then need to specify at compile time --target'ES6'
